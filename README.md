# Christine Fletcher's Portfolio
This is a portfolio website for Christine Fletcher, a full-stack software engineer. It is maintained and updated by Christine Fletcher. The site provides information about Christine, her skills, and current projects. There are several ways listed to get in contact with Christine via social media and a contact form. 

#### Visit deployed site https://www.christine-fletcher.com

- Site was deployed using Netlify https://app.netlify.com/

- Netlify's form submission tool was used to send an email message to Christine when someone submits the form. This is a simple way to collect contact information without needing to set up a back end. https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms 
- Simply add this code to your HTML once you have purchased a custom domain name from Netlify, deployed your site, and completed the set up on your account to connect the form and your email address.
    <form class="contact-form" name="contact" data-netlify="true" method="POST">

# Motivation
Christine created this site to have a place to showcase her skills and projects. As well as share a bit of her personality and a little about her. She wanted a centralized place to provide contact information and learn about the skills and projects she has done. 
In the future she would like to add her own blog posts to the site, instead of having them on dev.to.
